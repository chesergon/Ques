Overview
A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, elements are added (enqueue) at the rear and removed (dequeue) from the front. It's analogous to a line of people waiting for a service where the person who joined the line first gets served first.

Features
FIFO Order: Elements are processed in the order they are added, maintaining a strict first-in, first-out order.

Operations:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
Front: Returns the element at the front without removing it.
isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Use Cases:

Task scheduling in operating systems.
Print queue in printers.
Breadth-first search (BFS) in graph algorithms.
Implementation:

Implemented using arrays or linked lists in JavaScript.
Arrays provide a straightforward implementation with methods like push and shift.
Linked lists offer dynamic size handling but require more complex node management.
// Example usage of a queue using an array-based implementation
class Queue {
    constructor() {
        this.elements = []; // Initialize an empty array
    }

    enqueue(element) {
        this.elements.push(element); // Add element to the rear of the queue
    }

    dequeue() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Underflow"; // Returns Underflow if queue is empty
        }
        return this.elements.shift(); // Remove and return element from the front
    }

    front() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "No elements in Queue"; // Returns No elements if queue is empty
        }
        return this.elements[0]; // Returns the element at the front
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.elements.length === 0; // Check if queue is empty
    }
}

// Example usage:
let queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
queue.enqueue(30);

console.log(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 10
console.log(queue.front()); // Output: 20
console.log(queue.isEmpty()); // Output: false
